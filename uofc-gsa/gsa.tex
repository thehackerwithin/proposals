\opening{Dear Graduate Student Affairs,}
The Hacker Within is a nascent graduate student organization at the University of 
Chicago which promotes basic \& advanced applied computational research skills across all 
disciplines.  Our model comes from a sister organization by the same name at 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison (\url{http://hackerwithin.org/}) and Dr. Greg
Wilson's online open Software Carpentry curriculum (\url{http://software-carpentry.org/}). 
The name was inspired by a suggestion of UW Prof. Paul Wilson that in order to 
accomplish the scientific programming tasks before them in their research that 
they would need to access ``the hacker within" themselves.

We propose to host presentations or discussions about open source scientific and quantitative 
computing every other Friday during `learning lunches'.  Occasionally on the off weeks 
we may offer additional short peer-led courses on software development tools of interest. 
With the accompaniment of snacks and enthusiasm, these meetings cultivate a community of 
students that serves as an invaluable resource to its members' computational endeavors.

Beyond our meetings, we deliver teaching materials to our peers and offer `bootcamps' 
covering topics from programming languages such as Python and C++ to software development 
tools such as version control and text editors. The first of these workshops took place 
on April 2 \& 3, 2012 and covered software carpentry inspired topics.  This bootcamp had
over 150 people sign up for only 50 available spots.

Interested graduate students sign up for our listhost in order to receive announcements 
of the biweekly topics and bootcamp teaching and learning opportunities.  We are writing 
to you today to seek support in terms of promotional capabilities, room reservations on 
campus, web space, and a food budget for snack at our events.  As basic computational 
skills dramatically increase the job prospects for alumni, we hope that you will look
kindly upon our requests.

\closing{Yours Truly,}

\end{letter}
